## Supporting Adults with Autism

### What is the site URL?
https://www.supportadultswithautism.org/

### What does the partner organization do?
Adults with autism have limited opportunities to work and be independent. Blissfullseeds.org is one of the few organizations trying to find employment for autistic adults by creating products such as bath soap, bath bombs, etc

### What were the partner organization challenges?
Blissfulseeds.org is a non-profit organization and needs help in the following areas:
1.	https://www.blissfulseeds.org/ - does not have a section on volunteers and adults with autism to sign up. They also do not have a section for supporters who can pledge a monthly contribution to the organization.
2.	The current landing page is not well organized, there are links broken or not functioning. The current owner has hired a 3rd party to maintain and develop the site, charging by a feature that presents a sustainability challenge.
3.	SEO will help blissfulseeds to stand out and create awareness, there is also a request to add functionality to conduct sale campaigns to help and benefit adults with Autism.

### Why do we have a different site than blissfulseeds.org?
Based on discussion with the partner organization, we did not want to disrupt the
existing production site. We developed a parallel site, supportadultswithautism.org to
add the missing functionalities, review and iterate. When the site is ready, we do a
domain swap to the old site domain.

### Who would be the users of the site?
There are 5 sets of users for the site:
1.	Owner – Administrator for the website
2.	Volunteers – For registering their availability and time
3.	Autistic Adults – Adults with autism who will be working at Blisfullseeds to produce products 
4.	Supporters – Supporters of this cause, who may pledge an amount on a monthly basis.
5.	Buyers – People who would like to buy products made by participating adults from blissfulseeds.org.

### What are the project deliverables?
1.	Enhanced and structured website for www.bilsfullseeds.org for volunteers, adults with autism, and supporters. 
2.	SEO across search engines, enabling the organization to be more discoverable and reachable.
3.	Functionality to build marketing and sales campaign on the site (limited to owner) to generate demand and sales.

### How will the new site be maintained?
As a part of my commitment, I have prepaid 2 years of site hosting fees. There is a
charge of $180/year to maintain and provide cart usage, this is the only monthly
subscription fee that blissfulseeds.org will need to pay on an ongoing basis. I will provide
enhancement/support functionality to the partner organization during and after the
coursework completion.

### When will the site go live?
We do not have a definite timeline; we are focusing on functionality before we swap the
domains.
