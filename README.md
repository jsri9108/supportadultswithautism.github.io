## Supporting Adults with Autism

## Team
Jeetesh Srivastava

### Partner Organization
Adults with autism have limited opportunities to work and be independent. Blissfullseeds.org is one of the few organizations trying to find employment for autistic adults by creating products such as bath soap, bath bombs, etc

### Partner organization challenges
Blissfulseeds.org is a non-profit organization and needs help in the following areas:
1.	https://www.blissfulseeds.org/ - does not have a section on volunteers and adults with autism to sign up. They also do not have a section for supporters who can pledge a monthly contribution to the organization.
2.	The current landing page is not well organized, there are links broken or not functioning. The current owner has hired a 3rd party to maintain and develop the site, charging by a feature that presents a sustainability challenge.
3.	SEO will help blissfulseeds to stand out and create awareness, there is also a request to add functionality to conduct sale campaigns to help and benefit adults with Autism.


### Deliverables
1.	Enhanced and structured website for www.bilsfullseeds.org for volunteers, adults with autism, and supporters. 
2.	SEO across search engines, enabling the organization to be more discoverable and reachable.
3.	Functionality to build marketing and sales campaign on the site (limited to owner) to generate demand and sales.

### Users of the Website
There are 5 sets of users for the site:
1.	Owner – Administrator for the website
2.	Volunteers – For registering their availability and time
3.	Autistic Adults – Adults with autism who will be working at Blisfullseeds to produce products 
4.	Supporters – Supporters of this cause, who may pledge an amount on a monthly basis.
5.	Buyers – People who would like to buy products made by participating adults from blissfulseeds.org.

### Project Engagement Plan
1.	Spent time on the site and identified problems and grouped them into co-horts. For ex: Broken links (most of the links on the menu bar), missing functionality (adding supporters and volunteers), navigation challenges, ability to conduct marketing campaign, multi-region support. 
2.	I will be conducting a 60 mins session with the owner of blisfullseeds.org to review my findings and understand if there are any other challenges or pain points.
3.	Marketing campaigns have been one of the main ask. I need to explore this area with the partner to understand more details around the campaigns and what is the intended outcome. 
4.	Build a project plan with deliverables and milestones identified, this would be the plan shared with GATech faculty and the owner which we will be working together on with periodic reviews.
5.	Every week a report will be submitted to keep track of the functionality identified in the project plan. GATech Faculty and myself will be reviewing progress against the deliverables. This will also be a time to incorporate any faculty feedback and changes.
6.	I will be meeting with partner organization on a bi-weekly/monthly basis and will be conducting demos to demonstrate the functionality (as we reach key milestones).
7.	Once we are ready with the site content and partner organization is ready to move forward, we will work with them to de-commission the existing site and launch the new updated version.
