### Partner Organization
– Adults with autism have limited opportunities to work and be independent. Blissfullseeds.org is one of the few organizations trying to find employment for autistic adults by creating products such as bath soap, bath bombs, etc

### Partner organization challenges
Blissfulseeds.org is a non-profit organization and needs help in the following areas:
1.	https://www.blissfulseeds.org/ - does not have a section on volunteers and adults with autism to sign up. They also do not have a section for supporters who can pledge a monthly contribution to the organization.
2.	The current landing page is not well organized, there are links broken or not functioning. The current owner has hired a 3rd party to maintain and develop the site, charging by a feature that presents a sustainability challenge.
3.	SEO will help blissfulseeds to stand out and create awareness, there is also a request to add functionality to conduct sale campaigns to help and benefit adults with Autism.


### Deliverables
1.	Enhanced and structured website for www.bilsfullseeds.org for volunteers, adults with autism, and supporters. 
2.	SEO across search engines, enabling the organization to be more discoverable and reachable.
3.	Functionality to build marketing and sales campaign on the site (limited to owner) to generate demand and sales.
